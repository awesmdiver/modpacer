// Handles conditionFlags + conditionalFileInstalls (validated against "Smoking Torches and

// depending on choices made in two OTHER, unrelated install steps) and <folder> entries (whole
// directory copies, expanded here against the archive's actual listing since the parser alone
// has no visibility into what's really inside the archive).
//
// EXTENDED 2026-09-15 ("conditionalFileInstalls has to evaluate real conditions, not just flags"):
// a conditionalFileInstalls pattern's own condition is now evaluated as a REAL composite --
// fileDependency/gameDependency/nested And-Or, not just flags -- via conditionIsFulfilled/
// patternMatches below. Confirmed real, concrete bug this fixes: "Armory Extended - Bonemold Weapon
// Pack" gates each of its 6 patterns on a flag AND a fileDependency (the "with WACCF"/"without
// WACCF" variant of the same patch); the old flags-only check made both variants match at once. Also
// added: alwaysInstall/installIfUsable support for unselected group options (resolvePluginType, the
// second pass inside resolveChoices below) -- real but not confirmed in any archive this project has
// seen. See diagnostics/fomod-parity/findings-log.md items 9a/9c for the full audit trail and real
// archive counts, and fomod-parser.js's own parsePattern/parseCondition header comments for why
// script-extender-version dependencies (fommDependency etc.) are a deliberate non-fix, not a gap.
//
// Destination-collision tie-break verified against Vortex's real open-source engine
// (Nexus-Mods/fomod-installer, XmlScriptInstaller.cs::InstallFiles/ShouldUpdate), NOT guessed:
// installation runs in phases, each with a hardcoded priority offset --
//   required/always-install files: -10^9 (lowest)
//   normal selected-option files:    0
//   conditionalFileInstalls files:  +10^9 (highest -- always beats a plain option file)
// Within the same phase (ties), the file whose SOURCE path is lexicographically greater wins
// (`fromPath.CompareTo(oldInstruction.source) > 0`) -- this is a pure string comparison, NOT
// "first wins" or "last wins" by processing order. Confirmed against the real mismatch: pattern
// "candles+ESPFE" (source ".../candles/ESPFE/...") beat pattern "torches+candles+ESPFE" (source
// ".../both/ESPFE/...") in real Vortex output purely because "candles" > "both" as a string --
// order of the two <pattern> elements in ModuleConfig.xml is irrelevant.

// implementation across runtimes -- this project's own established convention, e.g. this file's

// ONCE per resolveChoices() call from resolveInstalledFileState()'s own plain arrays (see that
// function's header, lib/missing-masters-scan.js), never re-fetched per pattern.
//
// Confirmed against the real engine (PluginCondition.cs's own GetIsFulfilled, via
